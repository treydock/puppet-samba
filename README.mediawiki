= Managing Samba with Puppet =

This module is currently only intended to be used on nodes that need to be Active Directory domain members.

This module relies on [https://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat puppet-concat].

This is a very rough draft and I am still in the process of making it work just right for my specific environment, but thought it may be of use to someone.

= Usage =

== Assign to node ==

The example below is a role I use to define similar samba servers in my environment, but the usage is the same for nodes.

<pre>
class role_samba_server {
	$concat_basedir="/usr/local/share/puppet"
	include concat::setup

	$workgroup = 'example.com'
	$realm = 'example.com'
	$primary_group = 'Domain Users'

	include samba::server
}
</pre>

== Share definition ==

Here's an example of a share definition.

<pre>
samba::share {
'example':
	path			=> '/var/www/example.com',
	writeable		=> 'yes',
	browseable		=> 'yes',
	invalid_users	=> 'root',
	valid_users		=> '@staff',
	create_mask		=> '664',
	dir_mask		=> '775';
}
</pre>


= To Do = 

* Fully document all options
* Expand the server functions this samba conig can be used for
